raycl
-----

A (currently) non-recursive real-time raytracer in Python, OpenCL and OpenGL.

Currently tested on a beefy NVIDIA GTX 570. Lesser cards may suffer.

Controls:
   * WASD to move around
   * Mouse to control camera
   * Space to go up
   * N to go down
   * O to change field of view

Notes:
   * Lighting:
      * Ambient lighting depends on the face of the block being viewed.
        Top surfaces get lit, bottom surfaces get darkened.
      * "Diffuse" lighting treats the camera as the light source. The
        amount lit/darkened by depends on the relative angle of the ray
        and the surface. It also falls away as 1/t instead of 1/t^2 to
        make it easier to discern the edge of a surface when it's in
        front of a parallel surface of the same color.

TODO:
   * Think up better name
   * Document dependencies
   * Gravity / physics
   * Portals / mirrors
   * Self-viewing / entity rendering
   * Make into a game
