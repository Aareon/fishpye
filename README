raycl
-----

A (currently) non-recursive real-time raytracer in Python, OpenCL and OpenGL.

Currently tested on a beefy NVIDIA GTX 570. Lesser cards may suffer.

Controls:
   * WASD to move around
   * Mouse to control camera
   * Space to go up
   * N to go down
   * O to change field of view

TODO:
   * Think up better name
   * Document dependencies
   * Give block discernible edges
      * Perhaps via lighting?
         * Light-source grid blocks?
         * Small number of non-grid light sources (like entities)
         * Reuse camera as a light-source
            * Angle of ray on the surface would determine lighting level.
   * Gravity / physics
   * Portals / mirrors
   * Self-viewing / entity rendering
   * Make into a game
